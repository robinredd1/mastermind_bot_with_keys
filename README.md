# mastermind_bot (rate-limit friendly, with keys)

This bot scans every 7s, trades multiple positions in extended hours and regular, 
and now uses batched API calls to avoid hitting Alpaca's rate limits.

Run on Replit:
1. Upload these files to a private GitHub repo.
2. Import to Replit.
3. Press Run. Look for `Account=200 Clock=200`, then trading logs.

**Note:** Replit free plan sleeps when tab is closed; use Always On or other hosting for 24/7.
